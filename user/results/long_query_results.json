{"query_number": 2, "query": "Hi All, I filed a criminal defamation case against two foreign nationals and their company (foreign entity but registered in India also as a Private Limited Company) for writing a defamatory email and spreading it with the help of the employer company’s official email system. Status in the case so far:- 1. At the time of filing suit in the court, we made 3 parties (accused) including the employer company in this case. 2. The court issued summons to both foreign nationals to appear in the court but unfortunately missed to issue summons against the company (3rd party in the case). Unfortunately, my lawyer neither noticed nor take any action to get issued summons against the company also. 3. Employer company received the summons issued against both foreign nationals and came in the court and submitted a reply (without having any summons sent to the company) and helped both foreign nationals to run away from the country. 4. They submitted a reply that both accused are not now working with them, while we produced dozens of proofs including videos that they are still their employees and the company is helping them to hide. Court took cognizance on our proofs and issued summons against the company in 340 CrPC case for producing fake/false documents and proofs. 5. Both foreign nationals never came in court. 6. Till now, the court has issued NBWs 5 times and both foreign nationals have run away from the country with the help of the employer company. Police have raided their office also twice. My Questions:- 1. How can I get issued summons to the company from the Court now in criminal defamation case (First Point - As it was also made a party at the time of filing the suit in the beginning and the Second point - Company helped them to run away from the country and we had produced dozens of proofs to establish it also including videos, photos, and other legal documents and 340 CrPC case has also been filed and summons have been issued in 340 CrPC to the company) 2. Please guide me with the provisions also 3. It is a criminal defamation case and both accused will never come back to India now. How can I get justice now? Can the court punish the company to help the accused running away from the country? If yes, Punishment can be in compensation format or jail (Company’s director or Staff who gave false proofs in the court)? Any judgment or provision or example/case?

{"query_number": 4, "query": "Hi I got married on Jul 2007, Wife was a christian and she converted to Islam and we got married in a mosque. We filed an affidavit for her name change and conversion and i currently have the originals of the same and the original mariage certificate issued by the Mosque in Bangalore. Now coming to the problem, we did not consumate the marriage until Nov 2011. She would not allow. Reason she gives is that she's not ready for that now. I was patient. She's verbally abusive. Filthy abuses if we get into an argument. Shouting, yelling, screaming and Swearing. I lived on the hope that once we consumate the marriage things would change. In early 2011 my wife complained of stomach pain. We went and checked and she was diagnosed with an Ovarian cyst which was impending tortion. Meaning a serious one. We had to take multiple MRI's to confirm. The only option the doctors suggested was a surgical removal of the cyst, and since we did not have any kids, they advised us to go for the kid asap, as the removal procedure involved in removing her entire right ovary. with 3 months we consumated our wedding after consulting with few of the leading doctors. She became pregnant in Mar 2012 and we have a baby girl who has just turned 3. Upon knowing that she was pregnant she insisted in going to her mom's house stating that she cant stay alone with me in kochi. I agreed. Her delivery happened in bangalore and i bore all th expences as well. Even after the child was born the abuses continued. It came to an extent that she started abusing me on the streets. Iam fed up. I help her with everything at home. Maid are expensive where we live, hence i helped her in all her chores.Right from washign vessels to cleaning the toilet. Taking care of the child, feeding the child etc., i work in a BPO and sleep for max 3 - 4 hrs a day i didnt mind coz i thought that im doing this for my family, wife and child. No complaints whatsoever and no regrets. But her abusing continued. We lived like a proper husband and wife only for 3 months, meaning we had sexual intercourse only for 3 months in this 8 years. After she was diagnosed that she was pregnant we did not have anything physical. I thought after delivery life would become normal . Nothing changeduntil this min, the last time we had an intercource was in Mar 2012. Her abusing continued, I warned her that i would go for a divorce if this continues. i warned her multiple times but still continued. I told her that im not able to love her the way i used to love her and ive lost it all. She made a big scene out of it and left home, took the child and went to bangalore. Its been around 7 months now since she's staying seperate with her parents. After she left i called her and asked her to come down to start a new life. she denied stating that she does not want her daughter to have a father like me. The 8 KMS between office and home was my world for the last 8 years. Im totally done with her. I dont want my daughter to grow up seeing me getting abused, i think that will affect her behaviour as well. 2 months After she left home i sent her and the child clothes for Ramzan, she sent it back to me stating that she knows to provide for the child. I asked their family to come and speak to my parents in coimbatore, they refused. We did not go as well. I asked her divorce, she denied. She acknowledges that we both cant live together under the same roof, however she is not willing to give me a divorce. She says live alone, come meet your child and live alone but i will not give a divorce. she also says that she would not allow me to see the child if i go for a divorce and she would bring up the child stating that her father is dead. She even threatend stating that if its going to end in a divorce she would destroy me and everyone in my family. Next month we are planning to go to their house and talk. Im very clear about a divorce. I wanna give Talaq and end this.

Let's call this POA Mr. POA_Buyer, also Mr POA_Buyer passed away 2 years back and he executed the sale deed on Mr X and Mrs Y's behalf in 2010. Mr. POA_Buyer was the father of Mrs. Y and the father-in-law of Mr X. Unregistered GPA document was notorized in 2009. Sellers: Builder: ABC Corp Ltd Landowners: 5 individuals Both builder and landowners are represented by Power of Attorney: Mr POA_Seller. This POA is registered in the sub-registrar office. Property Transaction Summary: Mr. X Sojer and Mrs. Y Sojer purchased a property from Builder A and the 5 landowners (sellers). Mr X and Mrs Y(buyer) were represented by POA_Buyer and BuidlerA and 5 landowners(sellers) were represented by POA_Seller and the sale deed was executed and registered in the sub-registrar office by these 2 GPAs, effectively transferring property ownership to Mr. X and Mrs. Y from sellers. Current Issue: 1. Seller's GPA was registered(buillder+landowners), while the buyer's GPA was not(Mr X and Mrs Y). Is it necessary for the GPA of the buyer to also be registered, GPA was only the signing authority, and ownership is in Mr. X and Mrs Y's name only. The new property transfer Mr X and Mrs Y now wants to do without any GPA to a new buyer. 2. Mr. X and Mrs. Y are facing questions from a new buyer regarding the registration of the GPA for Mr. POA_Buyer not being done. 3. Additionally, there is a typographical error in the sale deed, where \"Sojer\" is misspelled as \"Sojar.\" Solution: 3 opinions I learned based on the feedback on this case from 3 lawyers, they are follows: Opinion1. Registering the correction deed mentioning spelling mistakes and certifying the unregistered buyer GPA in the sale deed from buyer side as valid by Mr X and Mrs Y should solve the concerns and make everything legal. This correction deed can be executed by Mr. X and Mrs Y with the seller's GPA and registered. Opinion2. The Seller GPA becomes a witness to the new sale deed registration between MrX and MrsY with the new buyer. This protects from all issues that may arise due to an unregistered buyer GPA. Opinion 3: This issue has become too complicated and not recommended for new buyers to go ahead as the title to the property is not certain. Please suggest how we can solve this problem for Mr. X and Mr Y and also the new buyer so that new buyer becomes the rightful owner and also not face problems in reselling this property later.", "response": ["Section 125 of The Indian Registration Act, 1908", "Section 49 of The Indian Registration Act, 1908", "Section 59 of The Indian Registration Act, 1908", "Section 90 of The Indian Registration Act, 1908"]},

Her Husband, my brother-in-law who was then 42, is employed with a Leading Airways in a senior management position. Based on her family her Job profile, we accepted the alliance and soon after marriage within a month shifted to Mumbai. She also took a sabbatical for a year from her Job, and was planning to resign after a year. This was more of an insurance in case things don;t work as desired. Soon after reaching Mumbai, she realized, her newly found husband is carefree and self centered without any savings, living in a rented apartment and a huge liability. Her husband was not considerate about her and she found her self all alone without much support from him. In the mean time, she conceived but things didn't turn up better so after staying there for about 8 months with about 6 months pregnancy she decided to conceive at her paternal place, Kolkata. She flew back all by herself, and rejoined her Job. As an unfortunate turn of event, there was a delivery complication, and the baby was in NICU for more than a month. Even after that doctors advised to continue to stay in Kolkata. In the mean time, after staying 2 months with her in-laws she shifted to her parents place and continued to stay there. She requested her husband to help her financially, but he was not cooperative. Within a year and a half, it was soon evident that the baby boy was autistic. Even after all efforts travelling to different places including NIMHANS there were little improvement. There were still no support for her husband and used to irregularly wire her just 10,000 bucks for supporting his Kid though his net salary was closed to 90K/month. She was skeptical to fly back to Mumbai as staying with him for 8 months it was clear that he would not be able to support her and the Kid. Moreover without any physical, emotional and psychological support from him, she best decided to continue to stay in Kolkata with her husband occasionally visiting her. In the mean time with her savings and with my support she purchased an apartment with rest of the finance from Bank, the entire EMI being supported from her salary. She initially though that she can somehow change her husband's mindset by making him more accountable so added him as a co-buyer in the apartment. In the mean time she conceived again, and fortunately it was a normal delivery. But even after that her husband was not a bit supportive and even stopped sending money regularly. Things turned bitter and she is now least hopeful about the relationship. Now currently she is supporting her two kids, her Job her EMI all by herself, and our parents who are getting old is staying with her. She is now seriously contemplating for separation and ask for regular maintenance from her husband. Unfortunately at the current scenario, she is not in a good financial position to hire a good lawyer nor she knows any one out there and feels helpless as to how she should proceed.

But my wife could not conceive, we also consulted a gynaecologist and she said everything is normal. After 5-6 months she had severe pelvic pain and when we consulted an other gynaecologist, we came to know that she had severe uterian infection. She had a laproscopic surgery for it and she started to blame me for not having babies. She has always been very wild since her childhood as she and her parents told me. I also took her to a psychiatrist in the 4th year of marriage due to her violent behaviour. All these years I had ardently followed her and supported her in her business financially and physically. Further, she was never comfortable being at my parents house or if they came to visit us. She loved shopping, travelling and of course I always spent it for her. Which sometimes affected my financial situation. I was posted in Khargone district where she shown her violent behaviour and even banged my head on the door once in which I nearly could have lost my eye. My landlord knew about it. But since I loved her, I remained silent about it. Her family, my family, my landlords family who cared for her like their own daughter, all of them tried to change his behaviour, and she never changed her behaviour. Since she never liked to live in a small city and her medical condition gave her an opportunity to move to a big city. She started pushing me to get a transfer. Due to her, continuous push and abusive behaviour I could not help but ultimately applied for the transfer. Since I am in government organisation, getting a transfer takes time, she said that if you are not getting your transfer done, just shift me to Indore and you may come whenever you get your transfer orders. To save my marriage, I had no choice but to agree to her condition. She started living alone and started to mentally harass me everyday for being busy and not calling her many times a day or having long phone call talks. Later in December 2019 she started fighting with me, interrogating about my finances claiming that I am having an affair or I am going to prostitutes, since we did not had physical relations since Feb 2019. As it was not comfortable for me to have physical intimacy with someone who fought daily with me. Since I couldn't take it anymore, I told her that it would good for both of us to get separated and after that from past 3 months she is threatening me of filing a police complaint against me for mental harassment and that she will destroy my career and family.

{"query_number": 98, "query": "with reference to my previous question on maintainability of partition suit by daughter against her father during his lifetime in Guwahati Assam, advocates in the kaanoon panel have given some diverse arguments. Some has said it is maintainable and some has said it is not maintainable , because Assam is governed by Dayabhaga rule. Now as a common citizen I want to put the following arguments against the Validity of Dayabhaga rule- 1. The preamble of the HSA 1956 says\" it is an Act to codify the law relating to intestate succession among Hindus \" so in my opinion the Dayabhaga rule, which is not codified by Parliament of India is null & void. 2. overriding effect of HSA 1956 under section 4 (b)\" is any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to apply to Hindus in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act\". so in my opinion Dayabhaga is null & void in Assam. 3. When it comes to custom in conflict with the Act, the Supreme Court in Sheela Devi case felt that SEC.6 WILL PREVAIL OVER the old Hindu law. It was noticed by the Court that the Parliament enacted the Hindu Succession Act, 2005 with a view to confer right upon the female heirs, even in relation to the joint family property.

Then his wife insisted and pestered him to shift to his in-laws city Mysore, he denied initially, she started threatening saying she will commit suicide if he didn't agree for it.Finally he moved to Mysore after winding up his business and selling his immovable property at our place . Bought a house in Mysore in the name of her wife from the funds he mobilized. Joined in-laws business for some time and then he opened a separate shop in the in-laws premises itself as they could not do business jointly due some differences. At this point he planned to return to our native place and start all over again but wife did not agree then, In-laws provided the space (shop) to carry separate business by taking his signatures on RS 500 stamp blank paper. He could earn only to meet the expenses of a normal middle class family ,educating his two sons in engineering streams.But his wife totally unhappy with the developments as she needs to have a high class life style,so the differences cropped in and grown to a every day arguments and fights. Elder son ,a brilliant engineering graduate joined Microsoft in Bangalore, and left the job with in three months and started his own business and struggled for three years and could not establish himself and incurred some losses, exact losses known to him only.,so my brother was sending money to him for his monthly maintenance as all the capital investment given to him was depleted. Mean while, recently his younger son, engineering graduate looking for a job committed suicide due to depression and health problem (medical treatment and counseling was going on since three years when he made his first attempt to end his life.) After his death , the family totally collapsed and my brother had no \"piece of mind\" and he was totally disturbed , so he went to Thirupathi to seek blessings of Lord Venkateshwara and when he returned after 3 or 4 days, the most devastating things had happened here . One: his wife and elder son vacated the house taking away all the house hold goods ,articles and jewels leaving behind his clothes and personal items and handing over the keys to the house owner. Two: his shop is locked with master keys and he is unable to open the shop with the regular keys and carry on his day to day business. Three: when he went and asked about all this, with his in-laws ,they said we don't know ,go ask your wife and son only . Four : received threatening phone calls from son, saying don't try to break the shop doors if you do so, we will break your bones. Just simply take the left over items from the house and go away from us and do not try to contact us and show your face for one year at least. Five: My brother wandering here and there ( mysore and Bangalore) with out proper clothes and food since one week ,not knowing what to do. His health is also upset since two days. Six: He does not want us (brothers) to approach his in-laws, wife and son for discussion, saying that his wife totally disagreed to bring in any of our family members in to the matter. Seven: we financially helped him to approach police and advocates. He went to Mysore in the morning with some money to approach lawyer and take legal advice and police protection. we are all worried a lot and sitting helplessly here. Eight : son also taken away the car standing in my brothers name, so if something bad happens it comes to his head I am the only qualified and educated brother to him .so what and how best I can help him under this situation.

Took me to London for Honeymoon where only 205 love and 80% ill treatment(Verbal cruelty, insult, say me non-sense ,illiterate, ill-mannered, immature, no dressing sense). 5. He is Sr. manager earning 17 LPA and me in HR in Pvt company earning 20 k PM. 6. Do not pay me anything, even take everything from me also. 7. I fall sick due to his behavirol and mental torture in the month of may 2014 and dignosed with Brain TB(Due to stress, hypertension, malnutrition ) completely curable and Pregnancy. 8. He and his mother visted so many doctors to get the baby aborted but they failed 9. He took me to Fortis for treatment and his parents urged him to leave me home saying she need attention and care , he did the same saying she need care and she full attention. I took 1 month sick leave and mediclaim from my office. 10. He visited me on Sunday till july 27, 2014 but speak only little with me spend 2 hrs with me and then go back, besides this no phone call, no monetary support , no help. 11. All medicine, doctors visits are with my parents. 12. When I joined back office in the month of June 2014 after recovery, I insisted him to take me back home for which he gave me several excuses so that he cannot take me home and I got intention that he will never take me home.i resigned from my job with tha hope to go back to him as he said leave job first but after I stopped working he stopped all means of communication with me and ignored me like anything,no watsapp, no call, no message response . 13. When I messaged him 1000 times he messaged me in very rude manner that don’t disturb me as I don’t want to keep you with me I am fed up of you and much more and I cried a lot and informed parents, so my parents visited him to talk to hi, approached his parents to amicable settlement but no result came, my parents said all will be fine once baby born. 14. In the month of December my baby born and my father informed him and his parents about grand son they came running very next day and even I felt happy that now things will be alright. 15. But still my hubby and In laws didn’t talked to me well and only playing with baby, not concerned for me. 16. Later on feb 13, 2015 my MIL called to inform me that My hubby will come to take me back home so get ready and he will bring me to Chandigarh where his parents live. 17. I happily accepted and packed my bags and my parents were also happy that they are changed and all will be fine now as baby boy born. 18. I spend 3 month again without my hubby in an isolated room with no money, no help in taking care of baby and no support from my hubby. He visited 3 times there in Chandigarh but never talk to me, only formal talks happen between me and him and little of sex. 19. Then again his parents made a prelude to kick me and baby out of there house as am just like burden on them and wanted to get rid of me so they called there son on 29 making wrong allegations against me that I ued to fight and go out late night for walking which were absolutely wrong and called my parents and said to take me back. 20. My parents came, had a long discussion and all thing settled and my father took me on there words for 15 days and after that my hubby will come to take me back. 21. But that was my last time at that house after that they never called , message me, never picked my call. 22. So on day after 20 day uninformed me , with my parents and son went to my hubby house to live there but he made excuses that he is looking for some other house and will take her after some time once shift to other home in 15 days, but that day never came. 23. I messaged him so many time to take me ad 15 day also passed, when no communication so we approached his maternal uncle, his close friend but all our efforts failed , Then again I with my parents went at his home and this time he didn’t allowed to enter his home and when forcefully we manage to get inside he escaped and this was first time I called police and police tried to call him but he didn’t responded. 24. Then with police and neighbour knowledge we get to know that he is in very deep affair with a very affluent lady(40 + years of age) with 3 children and hubby live mostly outside , used to visit him almost every day and night and love each other from 2008, that’s why he don’t wish to keep me and baby and also he cleary mentioned that he will never ever bring me back. All his parents, mamaji anf friend know about it and it was just a so called marriage to bring a maid in the form of DIL to live at parents house in chandigarh and let son enjoy his life life before, they never loved my son and me and only tortured both of us. 25. My hubby is ever partner with that lady in her running business. And my hubby is greedy and lusty. 26. We Complaint in CAW cell Srinivas puri, mediation failed, when time came to file FIR now IO is saying not file any FIR and seems like IO is being compelled to say like this as earlier he was in our favour and even he know that he is wrong everywhere and having deep relation. 27. So kindly advise me what to do , what action can I take to give him a lesson. 28. I don’t want to give him divorce, I am maintaining me and son alone with very less money and other things , only old aged parents and 20 k salary even that too am in danger zone and have to leave job as baby need me full time. 29. Kindly suggest what course of action can be taken to get money, shared accommodation or separate house to take care of me and baby.

Considering that Kolkata was the last city that we lived together in, would Kolkata have jurisdiction? 3. In case the petition gets filed in Baroda first, can we move to Kolkata on the ground that my senior citizens parents (69 - father and 65 - mother) would represent with Power of Attorney as I am residing in United States? I am aware that jurisdiction is based on where (1) where the marriage took place (Baroda), (2) where the couple last resided (Kolkata) and where the girl currently resides (Baroda).

{"query_number": 122, "query": "I had paid Rs.4.0 lakhs in 2012 to a landlord as an advance for buying a house. She had got that house from her sister through a gift deed and her sister had got that house from her mother through a sale deed. For some reason, the agreement didn't get thru. The landlord send me a legal notice saying she is going to forfeit the amount. Since forfeiture was not mentioned in the agreement, a civil case was lodged to recover the amount. Initially, since the landlord didn't attend any hearing, an ex-parte judgement was passed. At the execution stage, the landlord appeared and applied for a miscellaneous case. I allowed for that and the case went on. In 2016 (July or so), judgement was passed in favour of me. Judgement was to pay money along with interest. Post this, landlord absconded. We filed for execution and court Amina could not find her place of stay (she was staying in a rented house) to serve the next set of execution steps. After a lot of exercises, I realized I can file a case to attach her property. In November 2017, we applied for attaching her property. Luckily, the court agreed to attach her property by looking at some old documents (that I had possessed during agreement). Amina and other procedures (like TAMTAM) were carried on. After this, suddenly her sister applied an objection in court claiming it's her property. When dug upon, we realised the landlord and her sister cancelled the gift deed and the title of the property was transferred back to the landlord's sister. Her sister even claimed she paid Rs.10.00 lakhs for cancelling the gift deed. Based on the above, I wanted to file a criminal case against the landlord and her sister saying the transactions were done with criminal intention of cheating me with my money. My advocate, Chidanand, who is usually unresponsive and gets ideas from me many times is again not responding to my calls. I had, in fact twice, gone to him asking to leave the case aside so I can find an alternate lawyer, but he convinced me saying, case is in the final stage and he will continue with due diligence and be responsive. While I know he is incapable, I had no other way than to stay with him all these days. Now my questions..... 1. What action can I take against the landlord 2. What action can I take against the advocate 3. What do I do now to recover money I was also thinking to file an objection for the application that was filed by her sister asking court to make the transaction (cancellation of gift deed) void, but advocate said that is not possible.

She is keeping total custody of the child and is not allowing the husband to see the child. My friend got married in 2010. He is from lower-middle income group. His wife is also working and is of much higher income than my friend. Due to petty issues now and then, his wife deserted him within 5 months of marriage. She was pregnant at that time and eventually gave birth to a male child in 2011. My friend (The Husband) wants to live together with wife and child and made several efforts. But all in vain. He was never allowed see the child, even at the time of birth Eventually, in 2015, he filed for Restitution of Conjugal Rights. The trial is about to begin. His wife is totally reluctant to join him (Counter filed to that effect). So, even if the court passes an order in his favour, his wife is not going to join him for sure. In addition, the wife would continue the fight in upper courts. At this point, he came to accept reality and want to seek divorce on the grounds of “Desertion”. The wife is not willing to join him in marital life. She is not willing to give him divorce unless he gives up the child. The husband is not willing to lose the child altogether. So there is no possibility for mutual consent. So, for child, he decided to file application for joint custody. The husband is in a dilemma as to how to go about the divorce. His advocate suggested him to withdraw the RCR and file a Divorce petition with Desertion as ground. My friend wants to seek second opinion from this forum as to the right approach. Is it possible to file Divorce petition with desertion as ground and stating that he is more than willing to live with wife and child and if that is not acceptable to the wife then he would like to get divorced ? Can the husband file Divorce petition without withdrawing his RCR petition ? Or should he absolutely withdraw the RCR petition in order to have the divorce petition admitted ? Can the husband file a Divorce petition and ask that it be heard together with RCR petition ? He really wants to live with his wife and child. But if that is not possible, he wants divorce. Whatever it is, the wife is contesting RCR. And she would contest Divorce as well. She just wants to trouble the husband and keep the child to herself.

I would like thank this valuable forum from the bottom of my heart for posting free legal advice in many matters which had guided the family like us which had became a prey under False 498A cases. I would like to bring to your kind notice that : My elder brother's marriage was solemnized on 07/05/2023 as per Hindu rituals.

There were no disputes in family at all. Now before marriage itself my elder brother and my sister in law (future Husband and wife) had awailed a personal loan of 9lakh in the name of my sister-in-law for their secondary source of income from homestay business. now after marriage since my SIL had demanded for moving out of station for work and settling there, thus inorder to not have burden of loan my brother had pre-closed their personal loan take in the name of my sister in law during Aug 2023. All the EMI towards that loan period was transferred to my sister-in-law from my brother from first EMI at Jan 2023 to July 2023. This pre-closure loan amount was demanded to be paid in hardcash to them by father-in-law of my elder brother( by visiting our home and demanded our parents ) for which our family had denied and pre-closed that loan only through digital transaction/net banking facilities. Now after this pre-closure of loan, My sister-in-law and her father and her brother -in-law had invited my family (which included my elder brother, father, mother and few elderly relatives) to have a talk at their home. Their elderly relatives consoled both my brother and SIL for resolving matrimonial dispute if any. Surprisingly after 2days of this visit, father in law of my brother had started demanding for 30lakhs to our elderly relatives, and said if our family denying to pay which he would lodge false complaint from her daughter and drag all of us. We had denied to his blackmail. Again the same had repeated from father in law of my brother and they demanded 25lakhs nor they lodge false complaint on our entire family.Again when refused, they started demanding 18-20lakhs.

The partner whom my father trusted was lying (about the money to the politician) and deceiving and defrauding my dad to steal his money, despite knowing my father was a heart patient with severe angina and heart disease.

I came across a message on her phone from April 2013 where she had texted her friend that she got married to this xxx guy. So I tried to dig in more and found some pictures of her on her laptop. After confronting her she told me she was engaged to this person and apparently they had court marriage but she told me it doesn't stand valid as she didn't go for second signature. I didn't know anything about court marriage and 30 day period etc. As she had studies law I believed her and forgot about the matter. But after I moved to London she decided to stay in India as she wanted to pursue her acting career in Bollywood. She said I want divorce and doesn't want alimony or anything from me. I did try to convince her but she didn't budge. So finally I decided to seek mutual consent divorce, but now since she failed in her career & out of money, she told me she won't divorce me.

As a husband and wife, we are not doing well at all. We have had trouble since many years and even now there are so many problems and so many dissatisfactions with each other. And I am considering going down the path of divorce. The only big problem to sort out is for the kid. I am Dutch citizen. My wife and kid are not. If I approach the court here and file for a divorce, I am sure it will happen easily and smoothly. But I want my kid to stay here in Netherlands. And also my wife, so that the kid could get to see both parents. But I somehow see it to be very difficult, and I am not sure she will be able to live and work here alone and manage the kid every other week. Also if things work out like that - how does the Indian law system approve of this divorce? Would it be possible that the divorce would be dragged to Indian courts and if it does, as a Dutch citizen would I have trouble? I am only worried about my wife going to India with the kid and deciding to not come back. Would she be in violation of any laws? As I have spoken to Dutch lawyers they tell me that it's not legal for your wife to take your kid to some other country. If the local law gives me the right to see my kid every other week and stay with her for every other week, then it's not legal. But what would happen if she goes and doesn't come back? How does all this affect my parents who are still in India? I don't know what to do and what this road will bring. But one thing is certain, it's very difficult to live a life like this and we need to get separated. This is not the life we want for ourselves.

He thinks she is uneducated and can't get a job anywhere and keeps torturing her on the same point. Though she is graduated and worked before marriage. Last year, she was beaten by him, so we registered an NC and took her to my home. She was at my home for around 8 months. He was not even asked her to come home. Once she returned home with her daughter. That time she got to know that his husband is dating another girl working in his office. When she asked him who is she, he accepted that she is my girlfriend and told her that you were dating your boyfriend for 8 months so now I have a girlfriend. But when we asked him what is going on he refused to accept it. He is treating her like a person who only responsible to cook and serve him. By the way, his parents stay at their village and they don't interfere with his son's activities. They just ignore it, saying that the girl is only an office friend of him. One day my sister got his chat history with that girl having romantic kisses and movie plans. He does not give any money for home expenses to my sister saying he has to pay the EMIs, but gifts headphones, a new mobile phone to that girl. Now during this Diwali, there was again an argument between husband and wife for the jewelry. My sister told him that I have sold my jewelry and got the money to make the food for him, but in reality, she didn't. That time he bit her on her hand and asked to leave his home shouting at her. Also told her that, now he will surely do second marriage with that girl. Then my sister got angry and hit him with a broom. Then he ran away by locking the door from outside. His father was also there when this happened but he did not say anything. She called us to take her along with us. Then we took her and went to the Police station and registered the NC about everything happened. Now she is living with us. She is saying I don't want to spend my life with a person who is characterless and claiming me as a characterless. Now I just wanted to take advice from a lawyer to take the next actions. We are not sure what should we do next, should we send her back to live a slave life, should we keep her to live along with us, in that case, can she get money or claim right in his property for a living? As her daughter is 3 years old, she is worried about her education. Also after 4 years of marriage, he did not even bother to create a marriage certificate.

(The property is being marketed by Indiabulls Ltd. and I heard about the project from a pamphlet circulated by them, near our office.All discussions during flat selection and booking were done with Indiabulls agents. This booking amount submission included a customer cancellation clause of no-refund of Rs. 2 lacs.)AT THAT POINT, WE DID NOT CALCULATE THE CARPET AREA FROM THE SHARED PLAN TO VERIFY THE CORRECTNESS OF AREA DEDUCTION FROM SBU TO CARPET AREA MAINLY BECAUSE A REPUTED ORGANISATION LIKE INDIABULLS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT. On 17-Aug-2017, we calculated the carpet area and observed that there is a discrepancy between the apartment area proposed by Indiabulls/developer(SBU 919 sq. ft.- standard carpet area is 70% of the same i.e. around 640 sq. ft.) and the carpet area of the apartment exhibited in the layout. The carpet area of C1 block as per the plan is around 400 sq. ft. (only 45% of 919 sq. ft.) which is much less than the deduced carpet area for a 919 sq. ft. apartment i.e. 640 ft. Immediately the same concern was raised with Indiabulls sales agent on 18-Aug-2017 and we got a response in email with an attachment, that the plan to be followed in real is the e-brochure plan (attachment) that depicts a carpet area of around 554 sq. ft. This resolved our concern to some extent and hence we DID NOT stop payment of the first cheque dated 19-Aug-2017. Later upon raising concern repeatedly with the Indiabulls sales agent about this gap between the original shared plan and the e-brochure, it was communicated by him that this deviation is a printing mistake in the original plan and will be rectified shortly by the developer. (NB - When we tried to contact the developer for resolution of the concern, we were told that we, customers, will have to connect with Indiabulls regarding ANY matter of the construction or purchase as we have purchased the property from them) After the above said both cheques were cleared, the first demand for payment arrived and the developer agreed to meet us in person. We visited the developer’s office on 25-Nov-2017 and learned from the developer that the original plan (that was told to be INCORRECT by the IndiaBulls sales agents, is the actual plan. The e-brochure will NOT BE FOLLOWED and its AREA DEPICTION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED by us. Hence the carpet area, based on which we had proceeded for the purchase and NOT STOPPED PAYMENT of the booking amount, DOES NOT HOLD GOOD. Based on the above scenario, here are MY questions : 1. What are the legal options that I can take for this matter (grouper into 2 categories) ? 2. Can I get my entire booking amount back as the cancellation is a result?

Doctor gave few medicines, life continued but marriage could not be consummed. Thereafter, in March,2018, I took her to a very reputed doctor in Gurgaon, she also wrote infections etc on her prescription and gave lot of medicines. In both the cases, I was asked to sit outside and nothing was told to me, but in gurgaon while leaving doctor told me that if these medicines dont work we will operate your wife. I kept quiet and left. Wife took medicines, but nothing happened. 2. She works in Gurgaon, I am the only child of my parents and my father is no more. So, we were just 3 people: Me, my mom, my wife. her bevaiour was very bad at home, to cut short, she found faults with everything my mom does. Whenever I argued with her, she cried badly and theatened to commit suicide. I had to keep quiet. 4. Then, in May,2018, she said she cannot live in such atmosphere. I was thinking of what to do, I used to call her brother, sister, but they didn't help, while going through we didnt get chance to talk about doctor. 6.Her mail box was open on my system, and I found her non vegetarian chat with 1 person (dated before marriage), in that chat my wife was asking for sex and telling about pain in her private parts etc. 7. I called my wife's brother, sister, told them about this chat and sent the chat to them on whatsapp and said i will call them in 10 mins. They saw the chat and switched off the phones. In the eveining I confornted my wife, she accepted the chat, called her brother, packed stuff, while taking her jewellery, took mother's jewellery, cash and left home. 8. Next day I called them, asked for truth but they said girl doesn't want to live and wants divorce and aksed their marriage expenses.I agreed and asked to tell what they spent (fact is they didnt spend anything, it was extremely simple marriage). They agreed they will tell me. 9. There after they stopped picking phone. I went to that gurgaon doctor again and showed her, her last prescrption and asked what is the disease, she said that she is not fit for sex, she needs to be operated and then go psycological counselling, she gave all this in writing. 10. Then, I again tried contacting them they said they are ready for mutual but never came back on terms. Then, I had no option but to file a case of marriage anullment with all doctors prescritions. 11. Now they have changed their nos., they have completely cutoff and they have also not filed any dv, dorwy nothing (I have audio recording of her brother,sister where they said that we never misbheaved with her, didnt ask dowry).

{"query_number": 308, "query": "1. I am Mr Debanjan Mandal. I have a flat at Jal vayu Residency, 337 Motilal Gupta Road Kolkata-08. The flat was bought from Air Force Naval Housing Corporation. I have own the flat since 2006. 2. My in-laws are senior citizens and dependent on me since the demise of their only son. Since 2006, my in-laws have been staying in the said flat and looking after the property with Power of Attorney. I being in service, I use the house for staying during my leave period from service. 3. There is no registered housing society of Jal vayu Residency; however there is a working management committee which is elected every year. In 2016 during the Annual General Body Meeting, the house passed a rule saying that only family members (owner and his/her blood relatives - parents, brother, sister, wife, children) can stay in the flat. Anyone else staying would be treated as tenants and will be liable to pay tenant maintenance charge which is Rs 400 above the normal or owner maintenance charges. 4. Due to this policy, my in-laws were treated as tenants in my own flat and this has really hurt their feelings. They have rendered enormous service for the betterment of the housing complex and it's occupants since its inception in 2006. They have always felt a part of the society being my in-laws. They are proud that I am a service military officer and when such an alienating rule was made by the ex-military personals it has really dent their feelings and pride on the military. 5. I have taken up the matter with the management committee on the following grounds (a) I have told that the house is a self occupied house as per my IT return and my family which includes my in-laws are using the house. (b) I have told that they cannot define my in-laws as tenants on the basis that it does not fall in their definition of family. (c) I have told in the letter that i will continue to pay as per owner rates till my query is answered by the committee. However they have not given me any reply and put me in the defaulter's list. This has been derogatory and insulting to me since i have always paid my dues in time. 6. I have never faltered on paying my maintenance charges. But due to the difference in charge and the difference in opinion between me and the committee, they have made me a defaulter and displayed my name in the defaulters list. This has hurt my reputation. 6. What are the probable course of action that I can explore legally to get my in-laws their due in the society and not be considered as tenants. is the management committee correct in considering my in-laws as tenants or taking tenant charges from me when the house is declared as a self occupied house.

{"query_number": 335, "query": "Hi Sir, Myself S. PRATAP REDDY, I have given Cheque to my plot owner under pressure and next day i have canceled cheque very next day.My builder has demanded extra 1 lakh on registration day which was not part of our agreement.Finally, on Registration day, he refused to sign documents as he is expecting/demanding one lakh for me. As I couldn't take the step backward, I have signed the cheque and handed over to him without mentioning payee name. Next day after that, i.e Tuesday I have requested the bank to stop the cheque. I would like to know legal consequences in this. FYI, That cheque number is not being mentioned in any legal documents. It's as simple as it is that plot owner has taken the registration situation as an advantage and demanded one lakh extra. Please advise me how to proceed on this further. Thanks Pratap Reddy", "response": "([\n\"Section 30 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\",\n\"Section 138 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\",\n\"Section 16 of The Contract Act, 1872\"\n])"},
