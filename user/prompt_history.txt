        Note: The query is about a husband seeking divorce, but the exact reason for the suit is unclear. Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita (BNS) does not explicitly mention Section 12, Section 125, or Section 498, as these are likely references to the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Hence, I have focused on relevant sections from the Hindu Code (Hindu Marriage Act and Hindu Law and Customs) that may be applicable in this case.
