    "query": "I am planning to buy a property which has fallen under the name of 2 sisters through partition suit filed in the court by a family member (I have that copy). The name in the partition suit and Khata (Bangalore development authority records) is the name before marriage, even though the suit was filed post their marriage. The court order has their husband's name as well (Eg. V Shashikala, W/O Sri R Rao) However, sellers want the money in the changed/new name after marriage. Their lawyer is telling me we can include both the name in sale agreement and deed (Eg. V Shashikala also known as R. Shashi) and put a notarised affidavit of name change. Can someone please guide me if this is the right procedure and I will not face any problem later? If not, please let me know the right way to go ahead with this transaction.",

    "query": "Hello Team, Me and my wife have been living together since the time of our marriage. My mother, sister or any other relative live separately and have never cohabited with my wife. Since the time of our marriage, my wife has been of a quarrelsome nature and often picks up fights for small issues. Her behavior is often very unpredictable.  Often, when she picks up a fight with me, she threatens to commit suicide and threatens to falsely blame me and my family for the same. Due to her fear and terror, it is becoming really difficult to stay with her. Once she threatened me to commit suicide by jumping from the 3rd floor of the building. She tries to blackmail me by giving all such threats which is causing immense mental trauma to me. Every now and then she threatens to implicate me and my family in false cases and says that if i don't listen to her then she will send me to jail. Sometimes she says that she will slap me. I have also tried to talk about her behavior to her father, but he responds and often tries to support his daughter. We even requested their parents more than 6 times to come at gurugram and discuss but they always ignore and not coming, not sure why. My wife's mother also threatens me that my wife will commit suicide and that i should be ready to face consequences, hence she asks me to give in to the wrong demands of my wife. My wife fights with me for hours and doesn't let me sleep. I have often tried to make her understand but she refuses to listen. I am living under the constant threats from her which is affecting my day to day life and causing tension to me. My wife has suicidal tendencies and in case any such event takes place, then me or any of my relatives i.e. mother, sister etc. are not to be blamed for it.  1.) Anyways if their parents will come here then after that also her behavior is not going to change. 2.) I have send an email to SHO for the same, Do i also need to visit police station to file the report or will email is suffice. 3.) If my wife in case commit suicide by entering my family name or if she don't write anything after suicide and in case their parents and friends will say that my family tortured her n all.. Then my question is that what precautions should i take to fight in case if she commit suicide. what proofs will work in that case. 4.) I have one flat on my name at my hometown, some shares in a father's shop, If she will file maintenance case then how can i avoid giving her large amount of money as she can also claim my property also. 4.) I don't want to live with her now. How should i leave the home and what case should i file. Please suggest",
